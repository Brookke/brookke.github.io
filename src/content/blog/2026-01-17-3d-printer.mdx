If you'd asked me a few years back if I thought I'd buy a 3D printer, I would
have said no. My experience of 3D printers back when I was in college was that
they were very slow, expensive, frequently failed mid-print, and needed constant
calibration.

At the start of 2025 I bought myself a
[Bambu A1 Mini](https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) printer. What
changed? Most of the problems I encountered in college have now been solved, and
more importantly, at a price point that feels reasonable. The A1 Mini cost £149,
comes with built-in bed levelling and flow rate calibration, and it genuinely
just works. The printer is compact too, which was an important given we live in
a small London flat.

My general philosophy when buying this printer was that I wanted to use it to
print useful and functional things. I didn't want to fill the house with a bunch
of useless plastic that would end up in landfill before long. A year on, I think
I've largely stuck to that principle.

Here are some of the things I printed this year. I'll leave you to judge if they
are useful!

## 1. Hooks and Mounts

I really didn't think that at the start of 2025 I'd be writing passionately
about the utility of being able to design and print the perfect hook but here we
are. They were the first thing I printed in January and the last thing I printed
in December. Standard adhesive hooks are often ugly or the wrong size. Designing
my own allowed me to match our needs, the decor, and the objects they hold.

### Magnetic Bike Helmet Hook

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/brooke/helmet-hook.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI * 1.5}
  cameraDistance={200}
  color={"#b3b3b3"}
/>

I embedded two magnets into the back. They snap onto a metal panel in our
utility cupboard, holding our helmets securely without damaging the walls.

### Wavy Hook

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/brooke/maisie-hook.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={150}
  color="#cf96db"
/>

These hold work lanyards in our hallway. A neat trick I have found is to use a
wavy pattern to embrace the 3D-printed texture rather than trying to hide it.
The objects end up looking more premium and intentional that way.

## 2. Ortlieb Pannier Buckle

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/brooke/ortlieb-webbing.stl"
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={50}
/>

Having a 3D printer and basic CAD skills makes it easy to repair items that you
would otherwise replace or leave broken. When I lost the buckle for my Ortlieb
pannier bag, I pulled out the calipers and modelled a replacement.

## 3. Storage Boxes

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer

  modelPath="/models/brooke/family-figures-box.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  cameraHeight={300}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={420}
/>

My partner Maisie needed some storage boxes for the therapy toys she uses at
work. This was actually one of the things that made Maisie excited about having
a 3D printer in the house.

## 4. Cable Wrap

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<Image src={dehumidifierWrapImage} alt="Dehumidifier Cable Wrap" />

Our dehumidifier lacked built-in cable storage, leaving the cord trailing on the
floor. I designed this custom wrap and attached it with double-sided tape. It's
a simple fix, but it makes the unit much easier to move and store.

## 5. Under Desk Drawer

_By:
[Benjamin Kott - Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/145324-desk-drawer-modular)_

<Image src={drawerImage} alt="Under Desk Drawer" style={{ width: "100%" }} />
I've always got a pile of random bits and bobs on my desk, so I printed this
under-desk drawer to help keep things tidy. It fits perfectly under my desk and
holds things like a portable SSD, and some stationery.

## 6. Apple Watch Stand

_By:
[MarcusP - Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/3464-apple-watch-stand)_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/other/apple-watch-stand.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  cameraDistance={200}
  color={"#be8dba"}

## 7. Laptop Stand

<Image src={laptopStandImage} alt="Laptop Stand" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

Holds both my home and work laptop, freeing up space on my desk for more 3D
printing!

## 8. Gridfinity

<Image

  alt="Gridfinity Storage"
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

A word of warning: this one is addictive. Before you know it you'll be measuring
every drawer in your house and printing custom inserts for everything you own.

[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) is a modular storage system that uses a
grid of interlocking bases and containers. Really useful for taking that junk
drawer of batteries, screws, and that random allen key you got from an Ikea
flat-pack and bringing some order to it.

You can use tools like
[Gridfinity Generator](https://gridfinitygenerator.com/en) to create the exact
grid and containers for your drawer. I also recommend checking out
[Tooltrace](https://www.tooltrace.ai/) which uses a photo of the object to
create a custom Gridfinity insert.

## 9. Ikea Organization Inserts

[NotSure - Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/968016-ikea-raskog-sorter)
and
[d4v3ig - Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1265694-ikea-raskog-organizer-trays)_

<STLViewer

  modelPath="/models/other/ikea-raskog.stl"
  rotationX={-Math.PI * 1.5}
  cameraHeight={300}
  cameraDistance={200}
  color={"#849bd2"}
/>

Our [IKEA RÅSKOG](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/raskog-trolley-white-30586783/)
trolley is great, but the storage is basic. Luckily,
[NotSure](https://www.printables.com/model/968016-ikea-raskog-sorter) and
[d4v3ig](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1265694-ikea-raskog-organizer-trays)
have designed some inserts that break up the shelves into more useful storage.

## 10. Bike Bottle Cage

<Image src={bikeBottleImage} alt="Bike Bottle Cage" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

I needed a bottle cage for my bike, but off the shelf versions clashed with my
bike lock mount. I found this excellent design, tweaked it to my exact needs,
and printed it in PETG for extra durability. It has survived several months of
use and shows no signs of wear.

## 11. AirPod Case

_By:
[Mohammad AD - Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/776040-airpods-pro-2-case)_

<Image src={airpodCaseImage} alt="AirPod Case" layout="constrained" />

Attached the top with a bit of double-sided tape, works great!

## 12. 3D Maps

_[Touch Mapper](https://touch-mapper.org/en/)_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/other/map.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={300}
  cameraHeight={400}
/>
These make great gifts for friends and family showing places important to them.

## 13. Board Game Organisation

<Image src={unoImage} alt="UNO Card Box" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

When you get a 3D printer, find your favourite board game and search for "3D
printed organiser" for that game. There are often awesome designs that make
setup and storage much better. For example
[this UNO card box by Tridense](https://www.printables.com/model/576903-uno-cards-hardcase)
holds all the cards in a compact box that's perfect for travel - much better
than the cardboard box they come with.

## 14. Tetris Balance Game

## FAQs

### What Plastic do you use?

- **PLA:** For decorative or indoor items (hooks, maps).
- **PETG:** For items needing heat resistance or durability (bike cage, outdoor
  parts).

### How much does the plastic cost?

I generally spend £10-15 per kilogram spool of PLA or PETG. The
[bike bottle cage](#10-bike-bottle-cage) used about 50g of filament, making the
material cost roughly 50p.

### What sites do you use for finding models?

I mainly use [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) and
[Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models). Both have a huge variety of free
models.

### What software do you use for designing models?

I use [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/) for most projects. It is free for
non-commercial use, runs in the browser, and uses a parametric system which lets
me easily adjust dimensions at any time. If I need to edit files that OnShape
cannot import, I use
[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

### Do I recommend getting a 3D printer?

Yes, if you enjoy making things. I love identifying an annoying problem around
the house and designing or finding a solution. Within a few hours, I can have a
custom part printed and ready to use.
