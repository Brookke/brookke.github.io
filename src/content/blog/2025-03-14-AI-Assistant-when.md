There's a frustrating disconnect between what AI appears to be able to do and what it can actually do. Because it's so convincingly human at times, you assume it should be capable of handling the same tasks you do throughout your day—things like ordering groceries, managing your calendar, booking appointments, etc.

But it can't.

We're missing the business deals, the orchestration layer, and the behind-the-scenes connections that would allow AI to execute and complete these tasks. So while AI keeps getting better at _seeming_ human, it’s not becoming that true general-purpose assistant we were promised.

Part of the challenge is that few companies want to give up their direct relationship with the customer. Not many businesses are willing to become a commodity.
