If you'd asked me a few years back if I thought I'd buy a 3D printer, I would have said no. My experience of 3D printers back when I was in college was that they were very slow, expensive, frequently failed mid-print, and needed constant calibration.

At the beginning of 2025 I bought myself a [Bambu A1 Mini](https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) printer. What changed? Most of the problems I encountered in college have now been solved, and more importantly, at a price point that feels reasonable. The A1 Mini cost £149, comes with built-in bed levelling and flow rate calibration, and it genuinely just works. The printer is compact too, which was an important given we live in a small London flat.

My general philosophy when buying this printer was that I wanted to use it to print useful and functional things. I didn't want to fill the house with a bunch of useless plastic that would end up in landfill before long. A year on, I think I've largely stuck to that principle.

So here's some of the things I have printed this year:

## 1. Under Desk Drawer

## 2. Apple Watch Stand

## 3. AirPod Case

Attached the top with a bit of double-sided tape, works great!

## 4. 3D Maps

_[Touch Mapper](https://touch-mapper.org/en/)_

<STLViewer

  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}

/>
These make great gifts for friends and family showing places important to them.

## 5. Ikea Organization Inserts

_By: [NotSure](https://www.printables.com/model/968016-ikea-raskog-sorter) and [d4v3ig](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1265694-ikea-raskog-organizer-trays)_

/>

Our [IKEA RÅSKOG](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/raskog-trolley-white-30586783/) trolley is great, but the storage is basic. Luckily, [NotSure](https://www.printables.com/model/968016-ikea-raskog-sorter) and [d4v3ig](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1265694-ikea-raskog-organizer-trays) have designed some inserts that break up the shelves into more useful storage.

## 6. Bike Bottle Cage

{/* <STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/other/bottle-cage.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={300}
/> */}

I needed a bottle cage for my bike, but off the shelf versions clashed with my bike lock mount. So I found this excellent design, tweaked it to my exact needs, and printed it in PETG. It's been working great for several months now and shows no signs of wear.

## 7. Hooks and Mounts

I really didn't think that at the start of 2025 I'd be writing passionately about the utility of being able to design and print the perfect hook but here we are. They were the first thing I printed in January and the last thing I printed in December. Standard adhesive hooks are often ugly or the wrong size. Designing my own allowed me to match our needs and decor and the objects they hold.

### Magnetic Bike Helmet Hook

<STLViewer

  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI * 1.5}
  cameraDistance={200}
  color={"#b3b3b3"}
/>

I embedded two magnets into the back. They snap onto a metal panel in our utility cupboard, holding our helmets securely without damaging the walls.

### Wavy Hook

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/brooke/maisie-hook.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={150}
  color="#cf96db"
/>

These hold work lanyards in our hallway. A neat trick I have found is to use a wavy pattern to embrace the 3D-printed texture rather than trying to hide it, the objects end up looking more premium and intentional that way.

## 8. Gridfinity

<img

  alt="Gridfinity Storage"
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) is a modular storage system that uses a grid of interlocking bases and containers. I've printed a few of these to help organize small parts like screws, batteries, and sewing supplies. There's a bunch of online generators like [gridfinitygenerator](https://gridfinitygenerator.com/en) so you can create the exact grid for your draw. And theres hundreds of premade inserts on printables and makerworld. There's also [tooltrace](https://www.tooltrace.ai/) which takes a photo of the object you want to store and generates a custom insert for it.

## 9. Storage Boxes

<STLViewer

  cameraDistance={420}
/>

My partner Maisie needed some storage boxes for the therapy toys she uses at work. This was actually one of the things that made Maisie excited about having a 3D printer in the house.

## 10. Cable Wrap

_By: Brooke Hatton_

<STLViewer
  client:visible
  modelPath="/models/brooke/dehumidifier-cable-wrap.stl"
  rotationX={Math.PI * 1.5}
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={330}
  cameraHeight={40}
/>

Our dehumidifier doesn't have built-in cable storage, so I designed a 3D-printed cable wrap attached it with some double-sided tape and solved that problem.

## 11. Ortlieb Pannier Buckle

<STLViewer

  modelPath="/models/brooke/ortlieb-webbing.stl"
  rotationZ={Math.PI}
  cameraDistance={50}
/>

Having a 3D printer also makes it easy to repair or fix items that would otherwise have to be replaced or left broken, I've done this a few times this year already. For example, I lost the buckle for my Ortlieb pannier bag, and replacements were hard to find, so I got the calipers out and modelled a replacement.

## 12. Laptop Stand

Holds both my home and work laptop, freeing up space on my desk for more 3D printing!

## 13. Balancing Tetris Game

## 14. Board Game Organization

<img src="/models/uno.jpg" alt="UNO Card Box" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

When you get a 3D printer find your favourite board game and search for "3D printed organizer" for that game. There are often awesome designs that make setup and storage much better. For example [this UNO card box by Tridense](https://www.printables.com/model/576903-uno-cards-hardcase) holds all the cards in a compact box that's perfect for travel - much better than the cardboard box they come with.

## FAQs

### What Plastic do you use?

- **PLA:** For decorative or indoor items (hooks, maps).
- **PETG:** For items needing heat resistance or durability (bike cage, outdoor parts).

### How much does the plastic cost?

I generally spend £10-15 per kilogram spool of PLA or PETG. The [bike bottle cage](#5-bike-bottle-cage) used about 50g of filament, making the material cost roughly 50p.

### What sites do you use for finding models?

I mainly use [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) and [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models). Both have a huge variety of free models.

### What software do you use for designing models?

I use [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/) for most projects because it is free for non-commercial use and works in the browser. It is parametric, so I can easily adjust dimensions at any time. If I need to edit files that OnShape cannot import, I use [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

### Do I recommend getting a 3D printer?

Yes, if you are the kind of person that enjoys making things. I've loved being able to take a problem or need and have a solution spend some time really enjoyed being able to take an annoying problem or issue around the house and within a few hours have designed or found a solution and printed it out.
