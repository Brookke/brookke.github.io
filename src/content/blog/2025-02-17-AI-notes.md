This post is a work-in-progress, capturing my thoughts on how LLMs can create compelling user experiences beyond chatbots.

## Beyond Chatbots

Chatbots are the obvious use case for LLMs. However, not every application benefits from one, and they often aren't the best user interface for most tasks. How can we integrate AI into products in more useful and seamless ways?

## ðŸŒ³ Examples in the wild

### Linear

If you have worked with me at all, you will not be suprised to see [Linear](https://linear.app/) get a mention here. Linear has some of my favourite uses of AI:

> Describe the issues or projects you want to see in a few words, and the corresponding filters will be applied using AI.
> <cite>[AI Filters](https://linear.app/changelog/2023-06-01-ai-filters)</cite>

AI filters works so well I donâ€™t need to learn a complex query language or manually tweak filters. I just type what I want, and it works.

> When you create Linear issues using the Slack integration or with Asks, we now pre-populate the title with AI-generated summaries to save you one step in the issue creation process.
> <cite>[AI Generated issues in slack](https://linear.app/changelog/2024-02-15-create-issues-via-email#ai-generated-issue-titles-in-slack)</cite>

This one feels like magic ðŸª„. Itâ€™s fast, seamless, and the first few times I used it, I didnâ€™t even realize AI was doing the work. This is what I want to see more of in the products I use and build.

### Granola.ai

Taking good notes during a meeting is hard. Granola.ai helps by letting you jot down scrappy thoughts during the meeting, then using AI along with the meeting transcript to structure them into clear, useful notes.

### How was your week?

Okay you have probably never heard of this one... and for good reason, it's a project I built for myself. I have been through countless 360 reviews and I always struggle to remember all the things I have done in a year. One of the things my manager introduces me to is the concept of a 5:15, every Friday at 5pm I spend 15 minutes noting down what I have achieved that week. Then at the end of the year I can look back across this to write my self reflection. However the quality of these notes can vary from week to week. So I made a tool to keep me honest and help me along the way.

The tool takes my weekly notes, evaluates them, asks follow-up questions, and generates a summary. Itâ€™s simple but has been super helpful.
